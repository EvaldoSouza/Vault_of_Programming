"Often considered the step done before programming". But it's not true, it overlaps with [[Analysis]] and [[Programming.]]

Is the process of converting requirements, gathered by analysis, into an implementation specification.  The design stage is all about how things should be done.
If we talk about Object-Oriented Design, the designer must name the objects, define the behaviors and formally specify which objects can activate specific behaviors on other objects.
The output of the design stage is an implementation specification.
