#concept 
Information stored, used or generated by the program.
Data typically represents the individual characteristics of a certain object.
It's important to separate the  attribute from the data value. For instance, the attribute *int quantity* receives a data value, that can change from object to object.
Attributes are frequently referred to as members or properties. Some authors
suggest that the terms have different meanings, usually that attributes are settable,
while properties are read-only.
