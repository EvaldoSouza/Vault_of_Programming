Classes describe objects.
They are like blueprints for creating an object. You might have three oranges sitting on
the table in front of you. Each orange is a distinct object, but all three have the
attributes and behaviors associated with one class: the general class of oranges.
A class can define specific sets of characteristics that are shared by all objects of that class
