#concept 

Behaviors are actions that can occur on an object. The behaviors that can be performed on a specific class of objects are called methods.
At the programming level, methods are like functions in structured programming, but they magically have access to all the data associated with this object. Like functions, methods can also accept parameters and return values.
Parameters to a method are a list of objects that need to be passed into the method
that is being called (the objects that are passed in from the calling object are usually
referred to as arguments). These objects are used by the method to perform whatever
behavior or task it is meant to do. Returned values are the results of that task.
