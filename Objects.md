#concept
"A collection of data and associated behaviors". (More or less what I have though, just a struct with functions)
Object *Oriented* means doing programming directed towards modeling objects.
So, [[Object Oriented Programming]] is a technique used for modeling complex systems by describing interacting objects.
Objects are instances of [[Class|classes]] that can be associated with each other.
An object instance is a specific object with its own set of data and behaviors; a specific orange on the table in front of us is said to be an instance of the general class of oranges.
