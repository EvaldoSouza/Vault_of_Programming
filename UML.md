Unified Modeling Language.
The syntax of a UML diagram is generally pretty obvious. fairly
easy to draw, and quite intuitive. Having a standard based on these intuitive diagrams makes it easy for programmers to communicate with designers, managers, and each other.
However, some programmers think UML is a waste of time. Citing iterative
development, they will argue that formal specifications done up in fancy UML
diagrams are going to be redundant before they're implemented, and that
maintaining these formal diagrams will only waste time and not benefit anyone.
